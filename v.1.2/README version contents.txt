v.1.2:

This is the near final product.

Missing:

All FR's are met client side, with the exception of server upload of images and time stamp (current strings are uploaded to represent
the time stamp and image filepath) This is because i am not sure how the server wants to accept this. should be a trivial addition.


Met:
all FR's ecluding the minor details mentioned above.
